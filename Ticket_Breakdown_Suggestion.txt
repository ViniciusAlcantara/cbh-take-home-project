*Ticket Breakdown suggestion for the new 'Custom Agent Id' Feature*

Currently, the id of each Agent on the reports we generate is their internal database id. 
We'd like to add the ability for Facilities to save their own custom ids for each Agent they 
work with and use that id when generating reports for them.

Ticket 1
*Title*
Allow facilities to save a custom id for each Agent (BE)

*Description*
We need to allow a user to assign a custom id to identify the 'Agents' on the reports and maybe other places.

*Acceptance Criteria*
- A 'custom_id' field, that accepts string values and it's not required, with size less or equal of 256 characters added 
on the 'Agents' table.
- The 'custom_id' property on the 'Agent' Model
- The get endpoints updated to return this new field where relevant
- The post/patch/put endpoints updated to receive this new param, allowing it to be saved or updated

*Estimation*
- ~1 to 2 days of work. 


Ticket 2
*Title*
Add a 'Custom Agent Id' field on the 'Agent' form

*Description*
Add a new text field 'Custom Agent Id' to store the user custom identifier for an 'Agent'.

*Acceptance Criteria*
- A new not required text field is created, with the label 'Custom Agent Id', that accepts 256 characters max
- When the value of the text field is updated/added, the form is saved and the page is reloaded, the value is still there
- Empty 'Custom Agent Id' field doesn't prevent the Agent form to be saved

*Estimation*
- ~1 day of work.


Ticket 3
*Title*
Update Reports to use the 'Custom Agent Id' as the Agent identifier

*Description*
Currently, our reports that uses 'Agent' data has our internal database identifier as the 'Agent' id.
Update those reports to use the 'custom_id' as the new 'Agent' identifier

*Acceptance Criteria*
- Reports use now the 'custom_id' as the agent identifier

*Estimation*
- ~1 day of work.
